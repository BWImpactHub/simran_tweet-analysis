<h4> Word2Vec </h4>
<p>
    > Word2Vec is a technique for representing words as vectors in a continuous vector space. <br>
    > The WordCloud class you are referring to is from the wordcloud Python library, which is used to generate word cloudsâ€”visual representations of text data where the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.
        1. Prepare text Data.
        2. Generate the Word Cloud.
        3. Display the Word Cloud.<br>
    > Sets the size of the plotting canvas in inches (15 inches wide and 6 inches tall).<br>
    > Visualizes the word cloud object named Disaster_wc.<br>
    > Filters the DataFrame dftrain to include only rows where the target column equals 1<br>
    > Refers to the tokens column, which is expected to contain tokenized text (e.g., lists of words).<br>
    > Iterates over each token (word) in the tokenized message.<br>
    > Adds each word to the Disaster_corpus list.<br>
    Example:<br> 
    <table border="1">
        <tr>
            <th> Target </th>
            <th> Tokens </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 1, ['flood', 'damage'] </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 0, ['happy','day']</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td> 1, ['earthquake','rescue']</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    > comDisa: A pandas Series holding the top 30 words.<br>
    > comDisa_count: A pandas Series holding the corresponding word counts.<br>
    > sns.barplot: Creates a bar plot where comDisa is on the x-axis and comDisa_count on the y-axis.<br>
    > plt.xticks(rotation='vertical'): Rotates the x-axis labels vertically for better readability.<br>
    > plt.show(): Displays the plot.<br>
    > The <b> gensim.models.Word2Vec </b> module allows you to create and train Word2Vec models for text vectorization.<br>
